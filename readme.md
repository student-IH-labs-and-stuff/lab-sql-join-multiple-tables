The database is structured as follows:
![DB schema](https://education-team-2020.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/database-sakila-schema.png)

### Instructions

0. Inspect the database structure and find the best-fitting table to analyse for the next task.
1. Using multiple JOIN() clauses display the `store ID`, `city`, and `country` of each store.
2. Display the total `payment amount` for each store.
3. What is the average film `length` per each `category`? Which category of films are the longest?
4. Display the 2 most frequently rented movies in descending order.
5. Display the top 5 categories with highest revenue (`payment amount`) in descending order.
6. Is the `Academy Dinosaur` movie available for rent from `Store 1`? If yes, display the `title`, `store_id` and `inventory_id` of the available copies of that movie.
